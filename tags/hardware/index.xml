      <description>Belief propagation on probabilistic graphical models such as Markov random fields is the basis for a variety of applications, especially applications in computer vision. In this project, we used Vivado-HLS, a C-to-gates framework to rapidly prototype and test a number of accelerators for belief propagation on an FPGA. We used a Xilinx Zynq platform and our experiments show that using a dedicated FPGA accelerator provides a 2x speedup compared to a processor-only approach.</description>

      <title>Active noise-cancelling headphones</title>

      <description>This was a semester long team course project as part of the Electronics Design Lab (the dreaded &amp;ldquo;EDL&amp;rdquo;) course at IITB. The aim of this project was to build an affordable pair of noise cancelling headphones.
We developed an analogue feedback based controller as a disturbance rejection control system; which had the added benefit of improving the sound quality of our relatively cheap $10 headphones. The main challenges in this project were to characterise the headphone-ear system (the &amp;ldquo;plant&amp;rdquo;) to get the frequency magnitude and phase response; as the system changes characteristics based on a number of factors, including the shape of the ear cavity, the way the headphones are worn, and the placement of the microphones inside the headphone cavity.</description>
