      <description>&lt;p&gt;Belief propagation on probabilistic graphical models such as Markov
random fields is the basis for a variety of applications, especially
applications in computer vision. In this project, we used Vivado-HLS, a
C-to-gates framework to rapidly prototype and test a number of
accelerators for belief propagation on an FPGA. We used a Xilinx Zynq
platform and our experiments show that using a dedicated FPGA
accelerator provides a 2x speedup compared to a processor-only approach.
Further, we note that the speedup is limited by communication bandwidth,
and that higher speedups could be achieved using a higher-bandwidth bus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Active noise-cancelling headphones</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a semester long team course project as part of the Electronics
Design Lab (the dreaded &amp;ldquo;EDL&amp;rdquo;) course at IITB. The aim of this project
was to build an affordable pair of noise cancelling headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We developed an analogue feedback based controller as a disturbance
rejection control system; which had the added benefit of improving the
sound quality of our relatively cheap $10 headphones. The main
challenges in this project were to characterise the headphone-ear system
(the &amp;ldquo;plant&amp;rdquo;) to get the frequency magnitude and phase response; as the
system changes characteristics based on a number of factors, including
the shape of the ear cavity, the way the headphones are worn, and the
placement of the microphones inside the headphone cavity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our control system resulted in a successful attenuation of noise, with a
peak cancellation of 17 db at 100 Hz. We aimed for maximum cancellation
at 100 Hz, as that&amp;rsquo;s the frequency of noise from appliances in an office
setting, like fans and airconditioning; when the AC mains supplies power
at 50 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our system was designed to work at 3 V, that is two dry cells. However,
we did not optimise the power consumption to maximise battery life,
given the limited time on the project; and because that would mean
micro-optimisation before macro-optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;
