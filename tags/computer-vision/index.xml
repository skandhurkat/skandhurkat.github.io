      <title>High-level synthesis of a belief propagation accelerator</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Belief propagation on probabilistic graphical models such as Markov
random fields is the basis for a variety of applications, especially
applications in computer vision. In this project, we used Vivado-HLS, a
C-to-gates framework to rapidly prototype and test a number of
accelerators for belief propagation on an FPGA. We used a Xilinx Zynq
platform and our experiments show that using a dedicated FPGA
accelerator provides a 2x speedup compared to a processor-only approach.
Further, we note that the speedup is limited by communication bandwidth,
and that higher speedups could be achieved using a higher-bandwidth bus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We developed EmoDetect, an open source system for identifying human
emotion from images. This system has an accuracy of around 63% in
identifying the correct emotion from amongst seven candidates. Our
experiments showed that humans did slightly better, with an accuracy of
74%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was aimed as a comparative study of different feature
extractors and learning algorithm combinations for the task of
identifying emotion from static images. Our study revealed that Gabor
features with a linear, soft margin SVM performed best.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CarDetect is a system to identify car numberplates (registration plates)
and car make and model. This system was supposed to help law enforcement
officials identify fake numberplates and stolen cars. I worked on this
project for over a year and achieved over 98% accuracy in recognizing
numberplate regions, and over 90% accuracy in recognizing car models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was implemented in OpenCV using C/C++. The code for the
project can be found on my GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that I&amp;rsquo;m no longer working on CarDetect. The code on my
GitHub repository has not been changed since 2011, with the exception of
adding a build system using CMake. I&amp;rsquo;ve also modified the code to use
C++11 features; including the multithreaded model, but performance is
not as good as the original Windows code, found in the Woe32 branch.&lt;/p&gt;
