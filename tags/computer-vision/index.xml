      <description>Belief propagation on probabilistic graphical models such as Markov random fields is the basis for a variety of applications, especially applications in computer vision. In this project, we used Vivado-HLS, a C-to-gates framework to rapidly prototype and test a number of accelerators for belief propagation on an FPGA. We used a Xilinx Zynq platform and our experiments show that using a dedicated FPGA accelerator provides a 2x speedup compared to a processor-only approach.</description>

      <description>We developed EmoDetect, an open source system for identifying human emotion from images. This system has an accuracy of around 63% in identifying the correct emotion from amongst seven candidates. Our experiments showed that humans did slightly better, with an accuracy of 74%.
The project was aimed as a comparative study of different feature extractors and learning algorithm combinations for the task of identifying emotion from static images. Our study revealed that Gabor features with a linear, soft margin SVM performed best.</description>

      <description>CarDetect is a system to identify car numberplates (registration plates) and car make and model. This system was supposed to help law enforcement officials identify fake numberplates and stolen cars. I worked on this project for over a year and achieved over 98% accuracy in recognizing numberplate regions, and over 90% accuracy in recognizing car models.
The project was implemented in OpenCV using C/C++. The code for the project can be found on my GitHub repository.</description>
