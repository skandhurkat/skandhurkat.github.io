      <title>LDPC decoding using residual BP</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a course project for CS6782 &amp;ndash; Probabilistic graphical models.
In this project, I study the application of two techniques to the
belief-propagation based decoding of LDPC codes, and compare these
techniques against a traditional sum-product LDPC decoder.  The first
technique, min-sum decoding was implemented in the 1980s by Tanner as a
method to reduce computational complexity of sum-product decoding. The
other technique, residual belief propagation optimises the order in
which message updates are scheduled in an informed manner, leading to
faster and better convergence. The two methods are combined and
experimentally evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High-level synthesis of a belief propagation accelerator</title>
      <link>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/hls-bp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Belief propagation on probabilistic graphical models such as Markov
random fields is the basis for a variety of applications, especially
applications in computer vision. In this project, we used Vivado-HLS, a
C-to-gates framework to rapidly prototype and test a number of
accelerators for belief propagation on an FPGA. We used a Xilinx Zynq
platform and our experiments show that using a dedicated FPGA
accelerator provides a 2x speedup compared to a processor-only approach.
Further, we note that the speedup is limited by communication bandwidth,
and that higher speedups could be achieved using a higher-bandwidth bus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EmoDetect</title>
      <link>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/emodetect/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We developed EmoDetect, an open source system for identifying human
emotion from images. This system has an accuracy of around 63% in
identifying the correct emotion from amongst seven candidates. Our
experiments showed that humans did slightly better, with an accuracy of
74%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was aimed as a comparative study of different feature
extractors and learning algorithm combinations for the task of
identifying emotion from static images. Our study revealed that Gabor
features with a linear, soft margin SVM performed best.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Delay-aware proportional-fair scheduling in OFDMA networks</title>
      <link>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/btp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project considers the problem of delay-constrained scheduling over
wireless fading channels  in  OFDMA  networks  like  LTE-Advanced
networks.   Existing  scheduling  algorithms are considered and extended
to OFDMA networks, and performance is evaluated.  Specifically, the
problem of scheduling users on the downlink in TD-LTE networks has been
addressed, and suitably modified proportional-fair and opportunistic
schedulers are proposed.  Their performance is evaluated in the context
of downlink in TD-LTE systems, and compared.  Further, a simulation
environment has been created which can be used for further analysis of
scheduling algorithms in TD-LTE networks, and which can be suitably
extended for simulating relay-assisted networks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multi-touch interface for visualising network information</title>
      <link>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/hci/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I worked on this project as a summer intern at École de technologie
supérieure, Montréal, Canada, under the guidance of &lt;a href=&#34;//profs.etsmtl.ca/mmcguffin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Michael
McGuffin&lt;/a&gt;. My work involved developing new
and innovative gestures for network layout manipulation. Over the course
of almost 10 weeks, I converted an existing interface from a
mouse-keyboard interaction technique to a touch based technique, with
special gestures like radial menus, toolglass widgets and popup menus to
enable easy and intuitive interaction with networks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Active noise-cancelling headphones</title>
      <link>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/edl/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2011 16:47:24 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/edl/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a semester long team course project as part of the Electronics
Design Lab (the dreaded &amp;ldquo;EDL&amp;rdquo;) course at IITB. The aim of this project
was to build an affordable pair of noise cancelling headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We developed an analogue feedback based controller as a disturbance
rejection control system; which had the added benefit of improving the
sound quality of our relatively cheap $10 headphones. The main
challenges in this project were to characterise the headphone-ear system
(the &amp;ldquo;plant&amp;rdquo;) to get the frequency magnitude and phase response; as the
system changes characteristics based on a number of factors, including
the shape of the ear cavity, the way the headphones are worn, and the
placement of the microphones inside the headphone cavity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our control system resulted in a successful attenuation of noise, with a
peak cancellation of 17 db at 100 Hz. We aimed for maximum cancellation
at 100 Hz, as that&amp;rsquo;s the frequency of noise from appliances in an office
setting, like fans and airconditioning; when the AC mains supplies power
at 50 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our system was designed to work at 3 V, that is two dry cells. However,
we did not optimise the power consumption to maximise battery life,
given the limited time on the project; and because that would mean
micro-optimisation before macro-optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CarDetect</title>
      <link>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/cardetect/</link>

      <guid>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/cardetect/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CarDetect is a system to identify car numberplates (registration plates)
and car make and model. This system was supposed to help law enforcement
officials identify fake numberplates and stolen cars. I worked on this
project for over a year and achieved over 98% accuracy in recognizing
numberplate regions, and over 90% accuracy in recognizing car models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was implemented in OpenCV using C/C++. The code for the
project can be found on my GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that I&amp;rsquo;m no longer working on CarDetect. The code on my
GitHub repository has not been changed since 2011, with the exception of
adding a build system using CMake. I&amp;rsquo;ve also modified the code to use
C++11 features; including the multithreaded model, but performance is
not as good as the original Windows code, found in the Woe32 branch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Text-independent speaker verification</title>
      <link>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/text-independent-speaker-verification/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2010 17:09:15 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/text-independent-speaker-verification/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We developed a system to identify users independent of their spoken
words. The system used Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) to
obtain a characteristic pattern of the user&amp;rsquo;s voice which was then
analysed by a three layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network.
We obtained accuracies of over 90% using this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire project was implemented in MATLAB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Text-dependent speaker verification</title>
      <link>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/text-dependent-speaker-verification/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2009 17:15:11 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://skandhurkat.github.io/project/text-dependent-speaker-verification/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a summer project in my first year. This system used an
ATmega128 microcontroller coupled with a 62256 SRAM module. It could
store and verify a 2 second speech signal by any one speaker. Support
for additional speakers may be added by adding an interface to an SD
card, and tweaking the code slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system was designed to be compatible with a computer microphone for
accepting the input signal.&lt;/p&gt;
