      <title>LDPC decoding using residual BP</title>

      <description>This was a course project for CS6782 &amp;ndash; Probabilistic graphical models. In this project, I study the application of two techniques to the belief-propagation based decoding of LDPC codes, and compare these techniques against a traditional sum-product LDPC decoder. The first technique, min-sum decoding was implemented in the 1980s by Tanner as a method to reduce computational complexity of sum-product decoding. The other technique, residual belief propagation optimises the order in which message updates are scheduled in an informed manner, leading to faster and better convergence.</description>

      <title>High-level synthesis of a belief propagation accelerator</title>

      <description>Belief propagation on probabilistic graphical models such as Markov random fields is the basis for a variety of applications, especially applications in computer vision. In this project, we used Vivado-HLS, a C-to-gates framework to rapidly prototype and test a number of accelerators for belief propagation on an FPGA. We used a Xilinx Zynq platform and our experiments show that using a dedicated FPGA accelerator provides a 2x speedup compared to a processor-only approach.</description>

      <description>We developed EmoDetect, an open source system for identifying human emotion from images. This system has an accuracy of around 63% in identifying the correct emotion from amongst seven candidates. Our experiments showed that humans did slightly better, with an accuracy of 74%.
The project was aimed as a comparative study of different feature extractors and learning algorithm combinations for the task of identifying emotion from static images. Our study revealed that Gabor features with a linear, soft margin SVM performed best.</description>

      <title>Delay-aware proportional-fair scheduling in OFDMA networks</title>
      <link>https://skandhurkat.com/project/btp/</link>

      <description>This project considers the problem of delay-constrained scheduling over wireless fading channels in OFDMA networks like LTE-Advanced networks. Existing scheduling algorithms are considered and extended to OFDMA networks, and performance is evaluated. Specifically, the problem of scheduling users on the downlink in TD-LTE networks has been addressed, and suitably modified proportional-fair and opportunistic schedulers are proposed. Their performance is evaluated in the context of downlink in TD-LTE systems, and compared. Further, a simulation environment has been created which can be used for further analysis of scheduling algorithms in TD-LTE networks, and which can be suitably extended for simulating relay-assisted networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-touch interface for visualising network information</title>

      <description>I worked on this project as a summer intern at École de technologie supérieure, Montréal, Canada, under the guidance of Dr. Michael McGuffin. My work involved developing new and innovative gestures for network layout manipulation. Over the course of almost 10 weeks, I converted an existing interface from a mouse-keyboard interaction technique to a touch based technique, with special gestures like radial menus, toolglass widgets and popup menus to enable easy and intuitive interaction with networks.</description>

      <title>Active noise-cancelling headphones</title>

      <description>This was a semester long team course project as part of the Electronics Design Lab (the dreaded &amp;ldquo;EDL&amp;rdquo;) course at IITB. The aim of this project was to build an affordable pair of noise cancelling headphones.
We developed an analogue feedback based controller as a disturbance rejection control system; which had the added benefit of improving the sound quality of our relatively cheap $10 headphones. The main challenges in this project were to characterise the headphone-ear system (the &amp;ldquo;plant&amp;rdquo;) to get the frequency magnitude and phase response; as the system changes characteristics based on a number of factors, including the shape of the ear cavity, the way the headphones are worn, and the placement of the microphones inside the headphone cavity.</description>

      <title>CarDetect</title>

      <guid>https://skandhurkat.com/project/cardetect/</guid>
      <description>CarDetect is a system to identify car numberplates (registration plates) and car make and model. This system was supposed to help law enforcement officials identify fake numberplates and stolen cars. I worked on this project for over a year and achieved over 98% accuracy in recognizing numberplate regions, and over 90% accuracy in recognizing car models.
The project was implemented in OpenCV using C/C++. The code for the project can be found on my GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Text-independent speaker verification</title>

      <description>We developed a system to identify users independent of their spoken words. The system used Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) to obtain a characteristic pattern of the user&amp;rsquo;s voice which was then analysed by a three layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. We obtained accuracies of over 90% using this approach.
The entire project was implemented in MATLAB.</description>

      <title>Text-dependent speaker verification</title>

      <guid>https://skandhurkat.com/project/text-dependent-speaker-verification/</guid>
      <description>This was a summer project in my first year. This system used an ATmega128 microcontroller coupled with a 62256 SRAM module. It could store and verify a 2 second speech signal by any one speaker. Support for additional speakers may be added by adding an interface to an SD card, and tweaking the code slightly.
The system was designed to be compatible with a computer microphone for accepting the input signal.</description>
