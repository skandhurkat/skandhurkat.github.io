      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a computer architect at Nvidia working on emerging application domains
including data analytics, telecommunications and HPC. I previously worked at
Microsoft as both a software and a hardware engineer on the Maia and Cobalt
programs developing the next generation of neural network accelerators and CPU
architectures. I received my PhD from
Cornell University, where I developed accelerators for machine learning
inference tasks and was advised by &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinez.csl.cornell.edu&#34;&gt;Dr. José F.
Martínez&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in smart
ways of implementing algorithms in hardware, and re-thinking the
hardware-software interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering (with a
minor in Physics) at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in&#34;&gt;Indian Institute of Technology,
Bombay&lt;/a&gt;. My thesis work then related to
scheduling users in OFDMA networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a private pilot and enjoy flying above the Pacific Northwest. I also
enjoy rock climbing, hiking, photography, really any excuse to enjoy the
spectacular outdoors. I also enjoy classical music, classic rock, or
just curling up on my couch with a good book and a cup of coffee or chai.&lt;/p&gt;
