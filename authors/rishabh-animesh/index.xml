      <description>&lt;p&gt;We developed EmoDetect, an open source system for identifying human
emotion from images. This system has an accuracy of around 63% in
identifying the correct emotion from amongst seven candidates. Our
experiments showed that humans did slightly better, with an accuracy of
74%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was aimed as a comparative study of different feature
extractors and learning algorithm combinations for the task of
identifying emotion from static images. Our study revealed that Gabor
features with a linear, soft margin SVM performed best.&lt;/p&gt;
