      <description>&lt;p&gt;Belief propagation on probabilistic graphical models such as Markov
random fields is the basis for a variety of applications, especially
applications in computer vision. In this project, we used Vivado-HLS, a
C-to-gates framework to rapidly prototype and test a number of
accelerators for belief propagation on an FPGA. We used a Xilinx Zynq
platform and our experiments show that using a dedicated FPGA
accelerator provides a 2x speedup compared to a processor-only approach.
Further, we note that the speedup is limited by communication bandwidth,
and that higher speedups could be achieved using a higher-bandwidth bus.&lt;/p&gt;
