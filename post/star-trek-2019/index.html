      <p>2019 marks a few anniversaries. It is the 50<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> anniversary
of the moon landings. It also marks fifty years since the end of Gene
Roddenberry&rsquo;s Star Trek (the original series).</p>
<p>As a bit of a Trek nerd myself, I figured that this is a great time
to review the technology shown in all the Star Trek series, and see
how close we are to the universe imagined by Roddenberry.</p>
<h2 id="interstellar-travel">Interstellar Travel</h2>
<p>Interstellar travel is the central premise in Star Trek, and serves
as the platform upon which stories are told. Unfortunately,
interstellar travel still remains the domain of science fiction. A
month after &ldquo;Turnabout Intruder&rdquo; aired, Neil Armstrong set foot on
the moon. Since then, humanity hasn&rsquo;t really travelled all that far,
although our creations since then are hurtling through space, beyond
our solar system into interstellar space, carrying upon them little
plaques and records that would hardly be adequate to convey the sense
of life on earth. Send more Chuck Berry.</p>
<p>Warping the universe to travel faster than the speed of light,
however, seems out of the realm of possibility for the foreseeable
future.</p>
<h2 id="transporters">Transporters</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, we are closer to this than I imagined. It is possible
to use quantum entanglement to transfer information across a
distance, and it is possible that a system using a very large number
of entangled particles may at some point be able to transfer a
massive object over a distance. At the moment, a group of scientists
in China have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00934">claimed that they were able to teleport a photon to a
satellite 300 km above the earth</a>.
Are you ready to have yourself be destroyed, one subatomic particle
at a time, while being simultaneously recreated in another location in
the universe? You may have to wait a long time. Even if that does
become a reality, would you like to have yourself disintegrated
atom-by-atom as you&rsquo;re scanned in one place, to be recreated in a
quantum-entangled state in another place? The process itself may be
an agonizing death.</p>
<h2 id="communicators">Communicators</h2>
<p>In 2006, I owned a Motorola Razr v3i. By the standards of modern
smartphones, it was a puny, underpowered thing, with just a 1
megapixel rear camera, a tiny screen, 256 MB SD card storage for
music, and GPRS/EDGE for internet. Yet, it exceeded the capabilities
of the original Star Trek communicators. Modern smartphones are a
marvel, so I&rsquo;d say we have this in the bag. For the cosplayers
amongst you, someone has created a replica of the hero prop used in
the series, which is basically a hand-held bluetooth speakerphone
that can connect to your smartphone, if you would like to live with a
less-useful device than your smartphone. For those of you who like
The Next Generation more, Google has created a little communicator
pin.</p>
<p>By the way, no modern smart phone has been able to capture the
emotional connection of owning a Motorola Razr. I wish someone would
bring it back for the sheer nostalgia.</p>
<h2 id="computers">Computers</h2>
<p>Back in the 60s, computers were these gigantic machines that really
didn&rsquo;t have any UI, so to speak. They probably had large spinning
tape reels or drums, with blinkenlights as they processed data. Not
very TV friendly to show someone feeding in a stack of punch cards to
these machines. Star Trek did away with this by making their
computers entirely voice controlled. This was great for TV, as the
computer could have a personality. Arguably, now Siri, Alexa, the
Google assistant, Cortana, are all probably inspired by Star Trek
computers in some way or another. Try asking Cortana, &ldquo;Beam me up
Scotty&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Computers today are so much more powerful than computers in the 60s.
A cellphone today probably has more computing power than all of NASA
did back in the 60s, yet, they were able to launch man to the moon.
As a computer engineer, I often wonder, where have all the cycles
gone?</p>
<p>It is interesting to see the evolution of computers throughout the Star
Trek universe. The Original Series had these buttons and blinkenlights.
While most interactions were voice-driven, sometimes, we would see
either Kirk or Spock drop in a plastic card that looked suspiciously
like a futuristic punch card or cassette. I strongly suspect that the
voice interactions in the original series were, just like warp engines,
a way to work around the limitations of contemporary technology.
Computers in the 60s used punch cards, magnetic tape, and were tedious
to program, hardly the subject of gripping television. Voice
interactions made for much better storytelling.</p>
<p>The Next Generation decided to go with the Okuda-gram touch interface
for all their computers, which is probably most familiar in today&rsquo;s
world of touchscreen devices.  It&rsquo;s crazy to think that college
undergraduates today have probably had all their computer interactions
via a touch screen, and much less with a keyboard and mouse, and almost
certainly never through a terminal. Voyager introduced the idea of
bio-neural gel packs, which were, apparently, biological neurons
suspended in a nutrient gel medium. Back in 2005, researchers at the
University of Florida <a href="http://research.ufl.edu/publications/explore/v10n1/extract2.html">used biological neurons suspended over a grid of
electrodes to control a flight
simulator</a>,
in a technique not too different from the bio-neural gel packs in
Voyager. Today, the hottest topic appears to be deep learning, which is
just us wasting computer cycles trying to emulate neurons to solve hard
problems. Do you talk to any of your digital assistants?  You&rsquo;re
interacting with a deep neural net. Search something on Bing?  Deep
neural net. Use machine translation? Deep neural net. Predictive text on
your phone keyboard? Deep neural net.</p>
<h2 id="universal-translators">Universal Translators</h2>
<p>Yet another storytelling device, universal translators allowed everyone
on the show to speak English, even the Firengi. Today, deep neural
networks translate our speech from one language to another on the fly,
in a device that fits within our pockets, connected to a device that
fits within our ear. Have any of you tried the live subtitles in
Powerpoint? The tool for poorly made slides can now transcribe and
translate, in real time, a presentation on any topic. The world has
never been smaller.</p>
<h2 id="tricorders">Tricorders</h2>
<p>Tricorders were devices that performed three functions &ndash; sensor
scanning, data analysis, and recording. Arguably, our cellphones
today can do all three. So can our fitbits, and other wearables. My
phone knows from it&rsquo;s accelerometer, GPS, barometer, compass, and
other sensor data whether I&rsquo;m sitting down, walking, biking, or doing
any other activity. It also knows whether the phone is on my body, or
is resting on a desk somewhere. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028111/windows-lock-your-windows-10-pc-automatically-when-you-step-away-from">My computer knows if I&rsquo;ve walked
away and locks itself
automatically.</a></p>
<p>Medical tricorders are also closer than one may think. Since the
technology has evolved gradually, we don&rsquo;t see devices such as
fitbits, pulse oximeters, blood glucose monitors, blood pressure
monitors as tricorders, they generally perform just one task.
However, Qualcomm and X-Prize teamed up to offer a 10 million dollar
prize for a device that can diagnose more than 15 medical conditions
better than a panel of certified physicians. Although no team won the
prize, it is only a matter of time before we have true medical
tricorders, they are a necessity.</p>
<h2 id="dna-data-storage">DNA Data Storage</h2>
<p>Multiple Star Trek TNG episodes featured plot lines involving DNA data
storage. &ldquo;The Chase&rdquo; featured a plot where a program is hidden in our
DNA.  In &ldquo;The Drumhead&rdquo;, a Klingon officer hides secret information in
protein sequences in his blood as a technique of spy craft.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re closer to storing data in DNA than we would think. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dna-storage/">Researchers at
Microsoft and the University of Washington</a> are
developing techniques that would allow us to store data in artificial
DNA strands. The new technology promises storage of up to one exabyte
per cubic millimeter with a half life of 500 years.</p>
<h2 id="holodecks">Holodecks</h2>
<p>TNG introduced us to holodecks, the magical black rooms with yellow
grids within the Starship that could become any place one wanted, as
long as it was programmed into the computer. Virtual and augmented
reality technology is as close to giving us the same experience as the
holodecks.</p>
<p>One of the major issues with present day VR is that we&rsquo;re confined to
the physical dimensions of whatever room we&rsquo;re physically in. There is
some ongoing research in using X-Y treadmills to keep us in the same
physical space while we move around a virtual space, but this has its
limitations. The treadmills can only be reactive, moving us back to
where we started. At that point, the accelerometers in our ears tell us
that something has gone wrong, and the immersion is broken.</p>
<p>I wondered how Star Trek got around the confines of limited space on the
holodeck. As best I can tell, they never really answered the question. I
think that the light-matter holograms somehow moved under the feet of
the people in the holodeck, but that could easily be challenged if
everyone moved radially outwards in a simulation of flat terrain. In the
very first episode of TNG, Data showed Riker the extent of the holodeck
by throwing a holo-rock at the wall. Ah well, some things are best left
unexplained.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>Speaking of Data, we&rsquo;re nowhere near the level of sophistication that we
require for creating, what is essentially an artificial life form. Our
robotics are woefully inadequate in even the basic kinematics that are
essential for bipedal motion, although <a href="https://youtu.be/_sBBaNYex3E">Boston Dynamics has done some
incredible work in that field</a>. Enjoy <a href="https://youtu.be/g0TaYhjpOfo">this
compilation</a> of robots falling over at various
competitions.</p>
<h2 id="subspace-channels">Subspace Channels</h2>
<p>Another effective storytelling technique, subspace communications allow
for real-time video calling between our hero, the captain, and some
shadowy admiral with a hidden agenda. These require an even greater leap
of faith than warp engines, because we know that no signals can travel
faster than the speed of light. Even if we developed an incredibly
powerful engine that could literally <em>bend the universe</em>, transmitting
signals in real time across a galaxy would require even more energy.
Battles in space would actually be very much like old naval battles
before the invention of radio. Communication would be slow, and news of
a battle could never make it back to headquarters.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-doors">Automatic Doors</h2>
<p>Strange as it may sound, automatic doors seemed like an impossibility
when the original series aired. The automatic doors were actually
stage-hands who received cues to open and close the doors. Sometimes,
they missed a cue, which lead to an actor walking through a closed door.
Today automatic doors are so ubiquitous, I marvel at the fact that they
didn&rsquo;t exist when the series was made.</p>
<h2 id="hyposprays">Hyposprays</h2>
<p>The magical injections that doctors used in Star Trek (possibly to be
compassionate to the poor actors whose characters needed injections
multiple times in each episode) are very close to being a real thing.
Researchers at MIT have developed a <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2012/needleless-injections-0524">Lorentz force
actuator</a> that injects drugs at high velocity into a
patient without the use of needles.</p>
<h2 id="other-technology">Other Technology</h2>
<p>Star Trek brought us so much technology, it is hard to list all of it in
a single blog post. We haven&rsquo;t even touched long-range scanners,
replicators (3D printers today), phasors, tractor beams, force fields,
shields, gravplating, cloaking devices, time travel, and many others.
Star Trek was groundbreaking, not just in the technology it showcased,
but more in the message it delivered. By distancing ourselves from alien
cultures light years away, it allowed us the opportunity to observe our
own biases and prejudices, laying it all in the open, criticizing us for
our narrow-mindedness. Arguably, it made us all better people. And that
is what fifty years of Star Trek is all about.</p>
